# OOAD

**SUSDorm - A tool to manage dormitory in SUSTech.**

This is the Object Oriented Analysis and Design(OOAD) course project at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech) in the fall of 2023. We use NuxtJS as front-end and Django as back-end.

## Frontend

## Backend

In the backend, we use Django as the basic framework which provides easy-to-use modern features. We use rest-framework to build our APIs, SQLite as database and Aliyun OSS as media storage.
